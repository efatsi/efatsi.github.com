Starting off week 4 in the new office. Bike ride to work is about 3 blocks shorter, severely cuts down on time though 
since I don't have any real roads to ride on at all anymore. The one downside is the Mountain Sun is no longer 10 steps
away from our front door but I'll just have to learn to cope. Today I did a lot of pairing with Pat on a client project
refactoring the way taxes are calculated. Red Green Refactor. Tomorrow I'm looking forward to getting the new code we
wrote encorperated into the code base, and being able to say I've 'contributed' to Viget! In other news, Hearts is pretty
much coded (in Ruby), I decided to whip up Spades real quick - i.e. copy paste Hearts, tweak it a bunch, tada. Getting
better at sticking to the red green refactor tactic, also getting less stuck. Started making the rails app which will
host all of these games, charting into unknown territory - should be fun!
