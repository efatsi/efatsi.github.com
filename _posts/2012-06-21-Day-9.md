Today was pretty solid. Was up pretty early so I could bike over to Sanitas for another morning hike with Pat "I want to set the record on this hill" Reagan, and Jason "No no, you guys just go ahead" Sperling. My todo list for Haxxor News had dwindled to password resetting, article scopes, and testing. The scopes tripped my up as I tried to work a date/range selection feature, I think the plan was to pair with Pat on it tomorrow but I got home and worked on an idea for it I had. So now I just cover the app with tests and get some of the pros to look through some of the progress.
