With the ruby card game code all translated into it's rails twin, I began writing tests to check what still worked and what didn't. Discovered some issues with my indexing/id'ing magic but the tests have been digging up a lot that needs reworking. Started at the game level, got half way through into rounds, will finish up that and crank out the trick level soon. That should push me to my limit of rails development as progress beyond that will involve users interacting with the app and each other. I'm guessing a fair amount of AJAX work being that things will change a lot and I don't want the page reloading all the time. Exciting stuff!
