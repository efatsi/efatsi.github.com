With the office pretty much all set up the crew was back to working hard today. My house also has some new posters
courtesy of the previous office residents. Anyway, paired a bunch with Pat again today working on refactoring some
of the tax and shipping code of a recently deployed project. And in the off time from that I've been pressing on with
the card game app. Hoping to make some real progress on Thursday (no work for July 4th tomorrow) and incorporate some of
the card game logic into the rails app.
