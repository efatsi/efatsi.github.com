In Boulder news, I'm excited to report that I couldn't really see any smoke coming off the front range today - house will not be burned down anytime soon! Stayed up pretty late redesigning the blog with the help of my up and coming designer/housemate. Started the day off continuing on with my TDD adventure of coding hearts, ran into problems when I discovered the program behaves differently whether you're testing it or running it. Strayed from the TDD path as a result but things are looking pretty good I think. Pat took a look at my voting code for Haxxor News so I spent the rest of the day tweaking things with his suggestions, and then failing miserably at getting AJAX requests to do anything. I have discovered a pretty awesome new musician by the name of Gregory Alan Isakov, and although these cheap headphones kind of hurt my head it's been worth it.
