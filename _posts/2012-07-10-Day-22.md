title: Refactoring The Ol' Code
tagline: Day 22

With the code review yesterday, there was a fair amount I could improve on with the Haxxor News site. I'm in the 'make it clean part of to "make it work, make it clean, make it fast" process. Certain things I can figure out myself but Pat and I paired for a bit today  starting the refactor process on password resetting. Moving a lot of logic away from the controllers and into models. A pretty odd bug popped up since one model is handling the password reset query, and the actual password resetting. Renamed some things to make it work in the end but I think there's still some cleaning up to do.
