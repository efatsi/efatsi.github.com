I'm going to run out of words meaning "moving forward quickly". Another productive day though. The controller refactoring has gone very well. First bit took about 20 minutes and the other 7 or so took just a few once I'd gotten the system dialed. Still have some unrestfull actions in there but they're where they should be and they don't do CRUD actions so I think it's acceptable. Whipped the sucker up on Heroku if you want to [test it out](http://play-hearts.herokuapp.com/) yourself! Still much work to be done for sure but you could theoretically play hearts with someone online if you wanted! Tomorrow I'll finish up the code cleaning, write some tests, make things instantiate automatically perhaps? And then spruce it up client-side!
