Fariday. Had another code review this afternoon. At my request. Being that the last time I wrote code with little assistance/intervention I had to restart my whole project I figured it'd be good to have the pros take a look at it. Much better than the last time! A good amount of refactoring suggestions to continue cleaning up my controllers but nothing too major. Looking forward to a good weekend of packing up all of my stuff, doing a little painting at the office, and watching a bunch of obscure sports (and awesome ones like diving) for the olympics. Let's go USA!
