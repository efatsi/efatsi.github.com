title: Day 10 - Just A Spec
---

So with the functionality of Haxxor News pretty much done, I got to work on writing tests for it. Pat sat down
with me in the afternoon for a bit to go over integration tests using RSpec and Capybara, it's some pretty cool
stuff and in another day or two once I merge together all of my progress and push forward with these tests, I
think I'll have a solid app. I think I might have thought of an idea for my next project as well - building a
Tincan'd-esque site but for playing cards easily with friends. Basically, I want to play cards with my friends 
from back home and in the burgh. I'll see what the crew has to say about it on Monday. In the meantime, looking
forward to a scorching hot weekend in Boulder!
