title: Day 1 - Yo

This is the first post of my blog detailing my days and adventures at Viget Labs, in Boulder, Colorado. Today was pretty exciting as I got to meet all of the employees at the Boulder office and get my machine set up with the tools I'll be needing for the start of the summer. I learned today that my high school tricks will not apply, and that I have a LOT to learn this summer. I'm ready to work hard and make the most of this however. As for things I don't understand and things I want to learn -- the broad category of everything should just about cover it.
