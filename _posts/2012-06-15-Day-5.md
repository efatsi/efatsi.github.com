title: Day 5 - One Week Down!
---

Another great day to wrap up a pretty mind opening and interesting week! Free Lunch
(Brunch in Boulder) Friday kicked off the day, it was neat to see the whole company
come together, and who doesn't like free food? Spent a good stretch of time on my
Haxxor News app for the rest of the day. Brian L. took a few breaks from his work
to talk thigs over and give me some hands on help. I'm trying to take in as much as
I can but with all the information out there it's a difficult and humbling task. The
app is coming along though, a majority of the functionality is all in there, just 
have to tweak everything here and there, and then hopefully learn what testing is from the esteemed TDD-master Pat. Hoo ah.
