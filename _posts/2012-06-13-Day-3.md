title: Me vs. Heroku
---

Today was an educational day. Enjoyed some beer with most of the Boulder office down at West End, but not after a day of work. Got going on the Haxxor News project and then remembered around noon that the app had to be deployed on Heroku so I switched gears and spent pretty much the rest of the day on that. Once again, things I've learned in college are getting in the way of real progress, but with some help from sifu Brian I was on the right path eventually. It's currently almost 10 pm but alas - the app is [up](http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/  "Haxxor News")!!!

Things I've learned - what Heroku is, and that I start paying more attention to instructions.<br />
Things I need to learn - how exactly Heroku works, as well as Rails.
