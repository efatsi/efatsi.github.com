Hit my first major wall today. After learning about javascript and ajax requests yesterday I was pretty pumped to improve the card game app, however this was a little more complicated than the example I'd been taught and I made very little progress over very many hours. In the last 20 minutes of the day I made a small breakthrough which was nice but by then it was time to take off. I'll hit it again on Monday and hopefully have the task wrapped up by the end of the day so I can work on completing the rules structure, and then actually start playing!
