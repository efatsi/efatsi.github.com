Well presenting went off without too much trouble. Many thanks to Khanh and Nate for playing hearts with me live, and to Noah for popping in from Midlothian! One glitch did surface when Khanh couldn't play a card and there were suddenly 27 points in the game, but compared to the new game/round disaster that occurred the night before with Tom and Danka I think things went pretty smoothly! Spent the rest of the day looking into iOS development. RubyMotion vs. Objective C in xCode. Deciding on the later since it's the native language, and it doesn't cost 200 dollars. The pipe dream is a game called Ball's Out created by Pat and Doug over TTT, but we shall see.
