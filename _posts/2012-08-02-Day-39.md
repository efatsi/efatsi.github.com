Wrote a bunch of tests today, got to the point where I was just writing tests to have coverage instead of actually testing. To actually test these properly I would have to spend a lot of time coding in situations, which I think would be prone to more error than the single line methods I'm trying to test. So I stopped. Probably something to ask the pros about. Than worked on the looks about. The app is currently a seizure inducing product since my little card images twitch off and back on every second. Wrote code so they don't reload unless they have to, but I feel like that's fixing a symptom and not the disease. Maybe some CSS code help might do it? Morexploring!
