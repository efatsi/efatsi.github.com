First of all - fantastic weekend. Second of all, my little progress made on Friday did not lead to much and after an hour or so of attempting to learn this on my own I asked Brian if he could show me the light. Which he did. In about 20 seconds. My understanding of this jquery stuff is still shaky at best, but I am now equipped with the knowledge to change  whatever I want with any click of any button, probably not in the most efficient fashion but I'm counting it as a major victory. I flew through my goal of AJAXing everything and with the last few hours of the day began refactoring. Everything is currently in an organized mess in my games controller now. Totally not maintainable, unless you're me and it is within the next 3 days while I haven't forgotten why I put things where I did. Assuming the usual number of things unexpectedly go wrong, I think by Wednesday I'll have a project I'll be proud of (on the back-end).
