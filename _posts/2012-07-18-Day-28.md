Sweet day. Started working on the client interaction with the card game site. At this stage in my first attempt things stared hitting the fan and debugging was pretty brutal. This time around though, I had some small saving/updating bugs, very isolated though and easy to take care of. I sat down with Jeremy for a but discussing the front end stuff which was pretty cool. Pointed me in a pretty good direction. So I've isolated every event to happen and have a page load with every action. Next I'll work on the 'choosing' of cards, and then get rid of page loads, incorporate some ajax and json (the uncharted territory), and be able to play some cards! Ah also took a lunchtime ride with Pat up the NCAR hill. Always fun.
