Spent a bit of the day refactoring, and then the rest of it writing tests for all of the new functionality and methods I've implemented lately. Found a few bugs here and there but overall the thing is looking pretty solid. Played a quick game against myself and two other computers with 2 different browser windows open. I won. Next on the list is making the computer players automatically play with a sensible delay time, and have javascript show this happening on it's own without any user input. Then make tricks and rounds propagate on their own, game progressing buttons will be gone (a good thing), and it'll be view code from then on. Also went out with the Boulder dev squad, with recent addition Mike, to the West End Tavern for Jul-IPA. Many beers were enjoyed by all.
