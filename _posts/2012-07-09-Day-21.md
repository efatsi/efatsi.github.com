Pushed on with the Card Game project of mine. I believe I've finished converting and texting all of the card game related code, so now all that's left is to work on how the user will interact with the site and actually play the games. For now it's just Hearts and Spades but I think developing more games in the future won't be too bad now that I've got some code to reference and reuse as I need to. Also had a code review today for the first internship project - Haxxor News. There's a medium sized list of things to make better in the next few days before the presentation on Thursday.
