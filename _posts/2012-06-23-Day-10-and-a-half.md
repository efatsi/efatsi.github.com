This is really for personal record, has nothing to do with Viget, and everything to do with how
great I feel about living in Boulder. I can't remember the last time I set my alarm for 5:30, but with
forecasted temperatures in the upper 90's, I wanted to get some mountain biking in before the sun 
started baking this land. Packed the car, was out the door by 6, found the trail within half an hour,
biked around some cows milling about then up a mountain for an hour. The trail was a little rocky but
still a blast, the temperature was perfect, the pound or so of leftover steak I had waiting in the car 
was delicious on the drive back, and I got to hang out with some friends through the internet while 
watching the season finale of "The Legend of Korra". This town is great.
