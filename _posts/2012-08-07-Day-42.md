Features are really flying in there in the nic of time. Presentation of this to whoever can be there is tomorrow and there's a list of things to get accomplished. Successfully tackled the Opentok bullsh\*t, all levels of it. When a new person enters the room, the object created replaces a div you have specified. Then if that person leaves, the div never comes back. So if that person joins again, the video just gets thrown up arbitrarily on the left. Not wanted. The challenge of placing the videos in their respective table spots might take some serious finagling. Regardless, the app is in a pretty good place, and hopefully the presentation goes well tomorrow!
