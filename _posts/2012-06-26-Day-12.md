title: Day 12 - Testing And Exploring
---

I pressed on with my new knowledge of tests. Spent the morning working on those, some of the afternoon getting started on some card game code, and then the last few hours pairing with Pat on the integration tests. I'm seeing the advantages of testing more with every day, realizing that with good tests your code will have a tendency to work more often. On the non-Viget side of life, Boulder's backyard is on fire. The Flagstaff Fire kicked up around 11 am today after a lightning storm passed through. Conveniently I live about as close as you could get so I had a good view of some flames last night but the fire has stayed over the ridge so Boulder appears to be safe.
