Today was an awesome day (I'm seeing a trend of those by the way). I got to pair with Brian on my app and while I was slow to pick up on things at the start we were cruising in no time and knocked out two refactoring tasks before the morning was up. Pat and I then hopped into our bike shorts and cruised up Poormans Road. By cruised of course I mean suffer up a steep grade while trying not to slip out on all the deep sand and gravel. No falls on the day though and after a quick stop at the [top](/poorman.html), were bombing the downside of the hill in no time. Spent the afternoon doing some refactoring of my own. I was intimidated by all of the suggestions Pat and Brian had come up with on Monday but the pairing has helped and I was able to clean things up on my own. I guess no one's reviewed the code and there are some nice long-ish case statements in the controllers, but I'm feeling pretty solid about it. Get to present the app tomorrow as well!
