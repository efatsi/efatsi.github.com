So I was a little bummed that I would have to back track a bit on the project. I felt like I had developed some solid code and the meeting went differently than I had hoped. But once again, believe it or not, Pat and Brian were right! I was hoping that once I got into the redoing of everything I would see the light and I definitely did. I flew threw everything. What took me about a week was almost all knocked out in one day. I owe this to the new organization of the code for sure, but also to the fact that I think I'm getting a hang of this test driven development stuff. Red Green Refactor. I'm much better at navigating and tracking down bugs, either with my code, or with the way tests interact with the code (reload and (true) fix most of my problems)(or I forgot to save a resource when I 'changed' it so changes don't stick). A little database-landy and a little less representative of what actually happens, but then again I'm not playing cards in real life, this all will happen in database land. So ya, desk is cluttered with a bunch of checked off to-do lists and little drawings to help me through this all, and I'm feeling pretty pumped again for this project.
