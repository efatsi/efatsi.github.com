title: Day 4, Ruby on Rails/Beer
---

Another very educational day. Started off with a quick little hike up the Sanitas Trail with Patrick R. and Jason S. Back at the office by 9 ready to work, and with Heroku running smoothly, I could finally focus on the Haxxor News app. Made my first pull request for the project, and had it chewed apart by Patrick R. and Brian L. This was really great though, I'm learning a lot about rails, and getting some quality feedback on my code style and quality. Left the office to attend Ruby on Beer over with the guys at Foraker Labs, good food, good beer, and a bunch of good guys and gals as well. Overall another great day at Viget!
