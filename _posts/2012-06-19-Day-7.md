title: Day 7 - Clean It Up
---

Got another pull request out and Brian again took a look at it a few times over with suggestions and ideas for me. Today was a lot about code organization, style, and efficiency. I'm getting a grasp on what Rails is every day, a lot of the files that I've always just seen hanging around now have a purpose (or don't, in which case they're gone). Working on DRYing up code (Don't Repeat Yourself), and making a habit of just writing good code first. Also got to whip out my math thinking skills to tackle the problem of counting recursive comments. It's always fun to have to think good.
