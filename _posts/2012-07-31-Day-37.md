TTT (Third Third Thursday (tuesday))! Worked a tad in the morning on the synchronous issue, I'm liking the idea of a game leader. But around 10 we popped into Caribou to watch a little presentation from Andy on the company - pretty cool stuff indeed. We then hopped into a team exercise of being given an iPhone feature and a market of sorts, and having to come up with an app combining the two. We got Cruise Ships and the Compass feature, made a pretty sweet cruise ship trivia game app, but Pat's Ball's Out idea definitely sounded sweeter, and probably profitable. Zipped off in the middle of the day to sign my new lease, then the rest of the day was spent screen printing an awesome Viget sign designed by Blair. Than many drinks were consumed in celebration of life.
