I was the only developer at the office today until lunch rolled around. And with our designing roommate Blair over at HQ 
I had the whole room to myself for a good while. When Pat rolled in on his newly fitted bike, we did some whiteboard
work to discuss the logging of votes for the Haxxor News app. In good rails form, I ended up building another polymorphic
table in the database to store them all. Not after going for the array method first though. Took care of all the little
stuff I could find as well, tomorrow should just be working into the password reset, article scopes, and dreaded tests.
Still trying to finish by Friday, we'll see what gets in my way.
