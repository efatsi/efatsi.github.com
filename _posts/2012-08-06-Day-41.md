So the app is pretty much together, there's a "table", and you have a hand of cards that actually look like cards. Things move a little bit on hover and click events, but not from your hand to the table, or back into the winner's side. Ah and instead of little pictures I'd like to be everywhere, there are just big red boxes. Easily replaceable once I get a hold of some pictures though. Gave OpenTok a try but really didn't make much progress besides reading a LOT. I understand how it should work but implementation is giving me some serious trouble. In true adult fashion, I spent the hours after work getting myself my very own bank account, a credit card, and a massive haircut :(.
