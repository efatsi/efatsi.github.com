So the last few days have been a struggle between me and Javascript. It's a whole new dimension in my mental model of how Rails works, and I'm still not completely solid on how exactly data gets passed around, what it can access, what can access it, what it can return, yada yada yada. I spitball a lot hoping one of my ideas works and today I nailed it. Adjusted some routes, controller methods, and javascript calls, and could suddenly get information moving through the system with ease. Rocketed off from there and now the card game is completely autonomous. It only ever stops to get required user input, or if it crashes - but I'm pretty confident those days are nearing their end. Lot of code here for sure, a couple times I went to write a method I thought would be useful but I'd already written it! Looking forward to a code review where I'll probably have to redo half of it, and THEN I'll get to make it look good!
