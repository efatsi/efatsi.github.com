title: Day 6 - Pressing On
---

Today pretty much flew by. Apart from the occasional animated gif distraction,
and an Illegal Pete's run for Buritto Monday, I was in the zone most of the day
cranking out some code. I made a todo list of things to accomplish 
with my Haxxor News site and didn't run into much trouble with any of the
self prescribed tasks. Brian stepped aside from his work for a while to review
my second pull request on the project and talk me through some of the concepts
and suggestions he had brought up. The app is really coming together nicely though,
I've discovered that Cancan is kind of a pain in the ass, I'll probably spend
some time switching authentication over to something more standard once I'm
done building all the features on the list. Looking forward to another great week
in Boulder though!
