I was pretty good about updating this everyday, until I stopped. With a few days left though I'll try to pick things up and finish strong. I spent a few days whizzing through some iOS tutorials, and currently have a folder full of apps with a few little features each (HelloWorld, alerts, buttons that do things, things that slide, pictures, etc.). Balls Out might happen one day, FaceTrain (Barn's idea) might see some development in the next few days. After I pushed the tutorials as far as I could without spending money I switched gears to a Rails app to remind me of my friends' birthdays. It's already come in handy as I realized my sister's birthday was yesterday since Date.today produced something that looked pretty familiar next to my sister's name. Good job BDay-Reminder.
