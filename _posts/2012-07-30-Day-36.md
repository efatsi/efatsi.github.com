Yet another great weekend in Boulder, Colorado. Packed up the house, fixed my shifter problem (with a knife!), did some outdoorsy things, etc. I spent the first chunk of today cleaning up the code a little more as per Pat, Brian, and Mike's suggestions. Disagreed with one when it came down to changing things up, kind of a situation specific thing. Anyway, then went on to try and make it look good. Gave that up after about 35 seconds though and decided the synchronous challenge would be more fun and in my range. Looked at private-pub, there might be a solution in there but I couldn't get off the ground and had doubts anyway. Hard coded in an automatic reload which occurs every second, went to test it out and sh*t just hit the fan. Too many people trying to be the boss, it was not pretty. Might go back to private-pub, might make a 'game-leader', maybe some more variables keeping things in line, we shall see...
