Ah just a fantastic day. The morning seems like a long time ago (probably because it's 7:45 and I still haven't left yet) BUT I recall doing some debugging here and there. Playing cards with myself trying to break whatever I could, then fixing it. Bike ride around Boulder with the out-of-towners, then I sat down with Blake for an hour or so pairing on some front end stuff. Normally that stuff is just frustrating but he made it seem pretty friendly, super awesome of him. I'm getting a hang of it, sass is the shit, my app looks a lot better (kind of like a card game), and I'm just feeling good about things. Bring on da weekend!
