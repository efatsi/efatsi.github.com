So I'm pretty much done with the back-end stuff. The master synchro idea panned out pretty well, a few bugs popped up but were promptly smushed with out too much trouble. Pretty pleased with how things have turned out, feeling comfortable with javascript now which is pretty cool, haven't written tests in a while - might hit that tomorrow. I borrowed some of Blake's time to talk about how to work some CSS code into this to make things look like a card game. Attempted to whip up something myself afterwards but ended up relying on rails code more so than CSS. Ended up with a 'hand' of cards that can move up and down depending on if they're clickable or chosen and what not. Then spent the rest of my day unpacking at my new place and having Eddy (a dog) literally fetch beers for me out of the fridge.
