So my usual bike ride in from South Boulder was pleasantly interrupted about 4 times with breakfast stops sponsored by whoever was involved with Boulder's Bike To Work Day. Being that I bike to work all the time I didn't feel too bad about stopping at multiple stops and loading another breakfast burrito into my bag. As for work, I looked back at the integration tests I wrote and cleaned them up with the knowledge I'd gained yesterday pairing with Pat. Feeling pretty good about them, I switched gears over to the card game project. Working on building code with Test Driven Development. It feels like a slower process but I feel better about my code and at any point never feel like I'm losing control diving into the rabbit hole of working on things. Excited for this project though, and for finishing up the Haxxor News app - still have a bit/lot to learn there.
