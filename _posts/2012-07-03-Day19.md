Skipped Day 18 to keep the multiples of 5 all lined up (no work yesterday). Totally spaced on the weekly Vigehike this morning. It appeared no ones feelings were hurt too badly, Pat's kind of a steel box though so it's hard to say. On the programing side of things, my project took a pretty great turn today. In classic form - I asked for some advice on a small problem I'd run into, and in the span of 4 minutes, I was given a totally new way to think about my entire project. I was hesitant at first because it seemed like a massive code overhaul just to fix the little problem at hand, but the reorganization wasn't too bad and as a result the code is MUCH more organized. Thus, less problems in the future. I was basically slapped in the face with programming knowledge. Looking forward to many more of these slaps as the project progresses!
