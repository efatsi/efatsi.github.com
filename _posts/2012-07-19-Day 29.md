Learning day for sure. The current state of the app is I can play a game of hearts against computer players (pretty stupid computer players) that follow the rules, and can pick my own card when it's my turn. Every time something changes though the page reloads - not something I want. After a pretty great bike ride with Pat and some of the guys over at Pivotal, I paired with Brian on learning how to make things AJAX responses. Which is sweet because now I can take what I learned, and playing card games won't ever use page loads anymore!! Super pumped to put this together. Capped of the day with a mountain bike ride in Batasso - so much biking. Really great trail though, and actually smooth!
