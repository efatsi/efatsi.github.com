Kicked the day off with the (mostly) weekly Vigehike. Changed scenery from Sanitas to the Royal Arch trail, still equally elevated and intense, more tree cover and old ladies though. Arrived back at the office showered and refreshed and prepared for the presentation of my very own [Haxxor News](http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/) site. It went pretty well, and as a whole I'm pretty pleased with the project. Learned a whole lot of useful things about the workings of rails, code conventions, organization tactics, and the beauty of testing. Red-Green-Refactor. Make it work, make it clean, make it fast. All things I'm trying to incorporate into the new card game app. I switched back to that after the presentation/lunch and finished up testing all of the models. Ran into a really odd problem where a test will fail (for a reason I have traced down and have no idea why) only after a test has been run 7 times consecutively. It's odd, and a headache, but maybe when I stop having computers play these games by themselves I'll get more of a grip of what, if anything, is wrong. Oh and the weather is gorgeous now all the time - it's fantastic.
