Pretty cool day as usual. With all the developers in crunch mode lately I've had time to work on my card game project. I've (mostly) followed the idea of test driven development, and am definitely seeing it's benefits. The code is getting pretty large and if there's a small issue in one part of the code, odds are it shows up somewhere else. Without the pile of tests I've written along the way, I could see this project getting very frustrating and out of hand. But it's not! I got to pair with Pat on a client project as well, some schooling in the art of TDD and code style. The learning session was cut short however once we lost internet ... and the office. The rest of the day was spent disassembling desks and hefting them into and out of the moving truck. The new place is pretty sweet though. Still looking to work on my TDD approach, and some AJAX instruction would be pretty sweet too given the success of my last attempt.
