Spent most of the day writing unit tests, writing integration tests, and then reading up on testing in general. I'm feeling better about the code as a result, finding a lot of hacky code that I wrote just to satisfy certain situations when I was writing it and testing it locally. Thinking about ways to refactor the code to be more stable, robust, all that jazz. Also sat down with Pat yesterday to talk about the internship so far. He gave the card playing meeting room a green light which is cool, starting to think about how I'm going to code up a bunch of card games. Looking forward to another fun and exciting week at Viget!
