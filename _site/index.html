<p>Well the blog is up and running. Compliments on the looks have come in but credit really goes to my friend - Mr. Bootstrap. Today was much more productive than day 1 - my new machine isn&#8217;t offering up any problems now that Brian took a look at it, AND there were free/delicious burritos to be had from Illegal Pete&#8217;s thanks to the monthly dev meeting where I got to meet the developers from the other offices. Bike ride home isn&#8217;t looking too fun as the smoke from the High Park Wildfire starts to roll in, but I&#8217;ve got some ruby/rails notes at home that I&#8217;m looking forward to whipping out for the newly assigned &#8220;Haxxor News&#8221; project. The learning continues!!!</p>

<h2><a href='/2012/06/11/Day-1'>Day 1</a></h2><br />
<p>This is the first post of my blog detailing my days and adventures at Viget Labs, in Boulder, Colorado. Today was pretty exciting as I got to meet all of the employees at the Boulder office and get my machine set up with the tools I&#8217;ll be needing for the start of the summer. I learned today that my high school tricks will not apply, and that I have a LOT to learn this summer. I&#8217;m ready to work hard and make the most of this however. As for things I don&#8217;t understand and things I want to learn &#8211; the broad category of everything should just about cover it.</p>
