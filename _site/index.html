<h2><a href='/2012/06/15/Day-5'>Day 5 - One Week Down!</a></h2><br />
<p>Another great day to wrap up a pretty mind opening and interesting week! Free Lunch (Brunch in Boulder) Friday kicked off the day, it was neat to see the whole company come together, and who doesn&#8217;t like free food? Spent a good stretch of time on my Haxxor News app for the rest of the day. Brian L. took a few breaks from his work to talk thigs over and give me some hands on help. I&#8217;m trying to take in as much as I can but with all the information out there it&#8217;s a difficult and humbling task. The app is coming along though, a majority of the functionality is all in there, just have to tweak everything here and there, and then hopefully learn what testing is from the esteemed TDD-master Pat. Hoo ah.</p>

<h2><a href='/2012/06/14/Day-4'>Day 4, Ruby on Rails/Beer</a></h2><br />
<p>Another very educational day. Started off with a quick little hike up the Sanitas Trail with Patrick R. and Jason S. Back at the office by 9 ready to work, and with Heroku running smoothly, I could finally focus on the Haxxor News app. Made my first pull request for the project, and had it chewed apart by Patrick R. and Brian L. This was really great though, I&#8217;m learning a lot about rails, and getting some quality feedback on my code style and quality. Left the office to attend Ruby on Beer over with the guys at Foraker Labs, good food, good beer, and a bunch of good guys and gals as well. Overall another great day at Viget!</p>

<h2><a href='/2012/06/13/Day-3'>Me vs. Heroku</a></h2><br />
<p>Today was an educational day. Enjoyed some beer with most of the Boulder office down at West End, but not after a day of work. Got going on the Haxxor News project and then remembered around noon that the app had to be deployed on Heroku so I switched gears and spent pretty much the rest of the day on that. Once again, things I&#8217;ve learned in college are getting in the way of real progress, but with some help from sifu Brian I was on the right path eventually. It&#8217;s currently almost 10 pm but alas - the app is <a href='http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/' title='Haxxor News'>up</a>!!!</p>

<p>Things I&#8217;ve learned - what Heroku is, and that I start paying more attention to instructions.<br /> Things I need to learn - how exactly Heroku works, as well as Rails.</p>

<h2><a href='/2012/06/12/Day-2'>Ball Is Rollng</a></h2><br />
<p>Well the blog is up and running. Compliments on the looks have come in but credit really goes to my friend - Mr. Bootstrap. Today was much more productive than day 1 - my new machine isn&#8217;t offering up any problems now that Brian took a look at it, AND there were free/delicious burritos to be had from Illegal Pete&#8217;s thanks to the monthly dev meeting where I got to meet the developers from the other offices. Bike ride home isn&#8217;t looking too fun as the smoke from the High Park Wildfire starts to roll in, but I&#8217;ve got some ruby/rails notes at home that I&#8217;m looking forward to whipping out for the newly assigned &#8220;Haxxor News&#8221; project. The learning continues!!!</p>

<h2><a href='/2012/06/11/Day-1'>Day 1</a></h2><br />
<p>This is the first post of my blog detailing my days and adventures at Viget Labs, in Boulder, Colorado. Today was pretty exciting as I got to meet all of the employees at the Boulder office and get my machine set up with the tools I&#8217;ll be needing for the start of the summer. I learned today that my high school tricks will not apply, and that I have a LOT to learn this summer. I&#8217;m ready to work hard and make the most of this however. As for things I don&#8217;t understand and things I want to learn &#8211; the broad category of everything should just about cover it.</p>
