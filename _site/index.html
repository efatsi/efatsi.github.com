			<p>I was the only developer at the office today until lunch rolled around. And with our designing roommate Blair over at HQ I had the whole room to myself for a good while. When Pat rolled in on his newly fitted bike, we did some whiteboard work to discuss the logging of votes for the Haxxor News app. In good rails form, I ended up building another polymorphic table in the database to store them all. Not after going for the array method first though. Took care of all the little stuff I could find as well, tomorrow should just be working into the password reset, article scopes, and dreaded tests. Still trying to finish by Friday, we&#8217;ll see what gets in my way.</p>

			<p>Got another pull request out and Brian again took a look at it a few times over with suggestions and ideas for me. Today was a lot about code organization, style, and efficiency. I&#8217;m getting a grasp on what Rails is every day, a lot of the files that I&#8217;ve always just seen hanging around now have a purpose (or don&#8217;t, in which case they&#8217;re gone). Working on DRYing up code (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself), and making a habit of just writing good code first. Also got to whip out my math thinking skills to tackle the problem of counting recursive comments. It&#8217;s always fun to have to think good.</p>

			<p>Today pretty much flew by. Apart from the occasional animated gif distraction, and an Illegal Pete&#8217;s run for Buritto Monday, I was in the zone most of the day cranking out some code. I made a todo list of things to accomplish with my Haxxor News site and didn&#8217;t run into much trouble with any of the self prescribed tasks. Brian stepped aside from his work for a while to review my second pull request on the project and talk me through some of the concepts and suggestions he had brought up. The app is really coming together nicely though, I&#8217;ve discovered that Cancan is kind of a pain in the ass, I&#8217;ll probably spend some time switching authentication over to something more standard once I&#8217;m done building all the features on the list. Looking forward to another great week in Boulder though!</p>

			<p>Another great day to wrap up a pretty mind opening and interesting week! Free Lunch (Brunch in Boulder) Friday kicked off the day, it was neat to see the whole company come together, and who doesn&#8217;t like free food? Spent a good stretch of time on my Haxxor News app for the rest of the day. Brian L. took a few breaks from his work to talk thigs over and give me some hands on help. I&#8217;m trying to take in as much as I can but with all the information out there it&#8217;s a difficult and humbling task. The app is coming along though, a majority of the functionality is all in there, just have to tweak everything here and there, and then hopefully learn what testing is from the esteemed TDD-master Pat. Hoo ah.</p>

			<p>Another very educational day. Started off with a quick little hike up the Sanitas Trail with Patrick R. and Jason S. Back at the office by 9 ready to work, and with Heroku running smoothly, I could finally focus on the Haxxor News app. Made my first pull request for the project, and had it chewed apart by Patrick R. and Brian L. This was really great though, I&#8217;m learning a lot about rails, and getting some quality feedback on my code style and quality. Left the office to attend Ruby on Beer over with the guys at Foraker Labs, good food, good beer, and a bunch of good guys and gals as well. Overall another great day at Viget!</p>

		<div class='post-content'>
			<p>Today was an educational day. Enjoyed some beer with most of the Boulder office down at West End, but not after a day of work. Got going on the Haxxor News project and then remembered around noon that the app had to be deployed on Heroku so I switched gears and spent pretty much the rest of the day on that. Once again, things I&#8217;ve learned in college are getting in the way of real progress, but with some help from sifu Brian I was on the right path eventually. It&#8217;s currently almost 10 pm but alas - the app is <a href='http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/' title='Haxxor News'>up</a>!!!</p>

<p>Things I&#8217;ve learned - what Heroku is, and that I start paying more attention to instructions.<br /> Things I need to learn - how exactly Heroku works, as well as Rails.</p>

			<p>Well the blog is up and running. Compliments on the looks have come in but credit really goes to my friend - Mr. Bootstrap. Today was much more productive than day 1 - my new machine isn&#8217;t offering up any problems now that Brian took a look at it, AND there were free/delicious burritos to be had from Illegal Pete&#8217;s thanks to the monthly dev meeting where I got to meet the developers from the other offices. Bike ride home isn&#8217;t looking too fun as the smoke from the High Park Wildfire starts to roll in, but I&#8217;ve got some ruby/rails notes at home that I&#8217;m looking forward to whipping out for the newly assigned &#8220;Haxxor News&#8221; project. The learning continues!!!</p>

			<p>This is the first post of my blog detailing my days and adventures at Viget Labs, in Boulder, Colorado. Today was pretty exciting as I got to meet all of the employees at the Boulder office and get my machine set up with the tools I&#8217;ll be needing for the start of the summer. I learned today that my high school tricks will not apply, and that I have a LOT to learn this summer. I&#8217;m ready to work hard and make the most of this however. As for things I don&#8217;t understand and things I want to learn &#8211; the broad category of everything should just about cover it.</p>
