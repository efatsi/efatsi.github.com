        <p>First of all - fantastic weekend. Second of all, my little progress made on Friday did not lead to much and after an hour or so of attempting to learn this on my own I asked Brian if he could show me the light. Which he did. In about 20 seconds. My understanding of this jquery stuff is still shaky at best, but I am now equipped with the knowledge to change whatever I want with any click of any button, probably not in the most efficient fashion but I&#8217;m counting it as a major victory. I flew through my goal of AJAXing everything and with the last few hours of the day began refactoring. Everything is currently in an organized mess in my games controller now. Totally not maintainable, unless you&#8217;re me and it is within the next 3 days while I haven&#8217;t forgotten why I put things where I did. Assuming the usual number of things unexpectedly go wrong, I think by Wednesday I&#8217;ll have a project I&#8217;ll be proud of (on the back-end).</p>

        <p>Hit my first major wall today. After learning about javascript and ajax requests yesterday I was pretty pumped to improve the card game app, however this was a little more complicated than the example I&#8217;d been taught and I made very little progress over very many hours. In the last 20 minutes of the day I made a small breakthrough which was nice but by then it was time to take off. I&#8217;ll hit it again on Monday and hopefully have the task wrapped up by the end of the day so I can work on completing the rules structure, and then actually start playing!</p>

        <p>Learning day for sure. The current state of the app is I can play a game of hearts against computer players (pretty stupid computer players) that follow the rules, and can pick my own card when it&#8217;s my turn. Every time something changes though the page reloads - not something I want. After a pretty great bike ride with Pat and some of the guys over at Pivotal, I paired with Brian on learning how to make things AJAX responses. Which is sweet because now I can take what I learned, and playing card games won&#8217;t ever use page loads anymore!! Super pumped to put this together. Capped of the day with a mountain bike ride in Batasso - so much biking. Really great trail though, and actually smooth!</p>

        <p>Sweet day. Started working on the client interaction with the card game site. At this stage in my first attempt things stared hitting the fan and debugging was pretty brutal. This time around though, I had some small saving/updating bugs, very isolated though and easy to take care of. I sat down with Jeremy for a but discussing the front end stuff which was pretty cool. Pointed me in a pretty good direction. So I&#8217;ve isolated every event to happen and have a page load with every action. Next I&#8217;ll work on the &#8216;choosing&#8217; of cards, and then get rid of page loads, incorporate some ajax and json (the uncharted territory), and be able to play some cards! Ah also took a lunchtime ride with Pat up the NCAR hill. Always fun.</p>

        <p>So I was a little bummed that I would have to back track a bit on the project. I felt like I had developed some solid code and the meeting went differently than I had hoped. But once again, believe it or not, Pat and Brian were right! I was hoping that once I got into the redoing of everything I would see the light and I definitely did. I flew threw everything. What took me about a week was almost all knocked out in one day. I owe this to the new organization of the code for sure, but also to the fact that I think I&#8217;m getting a hang of this test driven development stuff. Red Green Refactor. I&#8217;m much better at navigating and tracking down bugs, either with my code, or with the way tests interact with the code (reload and (true) fix most of my problems)(or I forgot to save a resource when I &#8216;changed&#8217; it so changes don&#8217;t stick). A little database-landy and a little less representative of what actually happens, but then again I&#8217;m not playing cards in real life, this all will happen in database land. So ya, desk is cluttered with a bunch of checked off to-do lists and little drawings to help me through this all, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty pumped again for this project.</p>

        <p>Came into the office after a truly fantastic Boulder weekend, excited to push the card game app to some new limits this week. I spent the day debugging a bit and refactoring the way the leader and dealer were kept track of (with seats!). Didn&#8217;t take too long at all, biggest obstacle was the fact that I&#8217;d forgotten to update the test database so it was just failing all over the place. Realized it pretty quickly though and was feeling pretty good about things. Until my meeting with Pat and Brian about my progress so far. There were some pretty major suggestions involving changing a lot of the way the system is currently organized. I was stubborn at first since I feel the way it is now is very representative of how a card game plays in real life, and then particularly not feeling so hot about it when I realized it would be easier to practically start over than simply change what I have now. I&#8217;m pretty sure I can knock it out in a good 2 days work though and get back to where I was with a more organized project. There are some cool things to dive into at that point given the way the site will have to update continuously - still pretty pumped on this project. Ahh, and <a href='/vigeclones.html'>this</a> is what happens when the intern is the last one in the office.</p>

        <p>Great day. I have return with full momentum to the card game application. I dug into that weird bug that popped up yesterday, and determined that the computer was just possessed, and afraid of the number 7. It&#8217;s pretty weird, if one of my tests has been run more than 7 times, then one of the functions, which changes an attribute of four &#8220;cards&#8221;, just decides to not alter one of the cards. In the past when I assume the computer has gone crazy it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;ve missed something and am being dumb, but this time &#8230; my computer is definitely just messing with me. Anyway, today I made some progress in the &#8220;make it work&#8221; field. I&#8217;ve written some (bad) code that lets me interact with a lot of my card game functions I wrote. But basically, I can step through parts of a theoretical game and see what exactly is going on in the background. Discovered a good amount of things that don&#8217;t work as they should - a testament to how much I have to learn about testing. All my tests passing should mean that the app works, but, nope. I&#8217;ve learned that I can&#8217;t rely on rails to list owned resources in the order they were assigned, and that I should be keeping track of things in a more direct way (i.e. confidently point to exactly what I want instead of pointing to the third thing in a list I didn&#8217;t create and hoping what I want is actually third in the list). I opened up a Dale&#8217;s Pale Ale and got to a pretty decent stopping point by the end of the day, realized that this internship is awesome, and am looking forward to a great weekend!</p>

        <p>Kicked the day off with the (mostly) weekly Vigehike. Changed scenery from Sanitas to the Royal Arch trail, still equally elevated and intense, more tree cover and old ladies though. Arrived back at the office showered and refreshed and prepared for the presentation of my very own <a href='http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/'>Haxxor News</a> site. It went pretty well, and as a whole I&#8217;m pretty pleased with the project. Learned a whole lot of useful things about the workings of rails, code conventions, organization tactics, and the beauty of testing. Red-Green-Refactor. Make it work, make it clean, make it fast. All things I&#8217;m trying to incorporate into the new card game app. I switched back to that after the presentation/lunch and finished up testing all of the models. Ran into a really odd problem where a test will fail (for a reason I have traced down and have no idea why) only after a test has been run 7 times consecutively. It&#8217;s odd, and a headache, but maybe when I stop having computers play these games by themselves I&#8217;ll get more of a grip of what, if anything, is wrong. Oh and the weather is gorgeous now all the time - it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>

        <p>Today was an awesome day (I&#8217;m seeing a trend of those by the way). I got to pair with Brian on my app and while I was slow to pick up on things at the start we were cruising in no time and knocked out two refactoring tasks before the morning was up. Pat and I then hopped into our bike shorts and cruised up Poormans Road. By cruised of course I mean suffer up a steep grade while trying not to slip out on all the deep sand and gravel. No falls on the day though and after a quick stop at the <a href='/poorman.html'>top</a>, were bombing the downside of the hill in no time. Spent the afternoon doing some refactoring of my own. I was intimidated by all of the suggestions Pat and Brian had come up with on Monday but the pairing has helped and I was able to clean things up on my own. I guess no one&#8217;s reviewed the code and there are some nice long-ish case statements in the controllers, but I&#8217;m feeling pretty solid about it. Get to present the app tomorrow as well!</p>

        <p>With the code review yesterday, there was a fair amount I could improve on with the Haxxor News site. I&#8217;m in the &#8216;make it clean part of to &#8220;make it work, make it clean, make it fast&#8221; process. Certain things I can figure out myself but Pat and I paired for a bit today starting the refactor process on password resetting. Moving a lot of logic away from the controllers and into models. A pretty odd bug popped up since one model is handling the password reset query, and the actual password resetting. Renamed some things to make it work in the end but I think there&#8217;s still some cleaning up to do.</p>

        <p>Pushed on with the Card Game project of mine. I believe I&#8217;ve finished converting and texting all of the card game related code, so now all that&#8217;s left is to work on how the user will interact with the site and actually play the games. For now it&#8217;s just Hearts and Spades but I think developing more games in the future won&#8217;t be too bad now that I&#8217;ve got some code to reference and reuse as I need to. Also had a code review today for the first internship project - Haxxor News. There&#8217;s a medium sized list of things to make better in the next few days before the presentation on Thursday.</p>

        <p>With the ruby card game code all translated into it&#8217;s rails twin, I began writing tests to check what still worked and what didn&#8217;t. Discovered some issues with my indexing/id&#8217;ing magic but the tests have been digging up a lot that needs reworking. Started at the game level, got half way through into rounds, will finish up that and crank out the trick level soon. That should push me to my limit of rails development as progress beyond that will involve users interacting with the app and each other. I&#8217;m guessing a fair amount of AJAX work being that things will change a lot and I don&#8217;t want the page reloading all the time. Exciting stuff!</p>

        <p>Skipped Day 18 to keep the multiples of 5 all lined up (no work yesterday). Totally spaced on the weekly Vigehike this morning. It appeared no ones feelings were hurt too badly, Pat&#8217;s kind of a steel box though so it&#8217;s hard to say. On the programing side of things, my project took a pretty great turn today. In classic form - I asked for some advice on a small problem I&#8217;d run into, and in the span of 4 minutes, I was given a totally new way to think about my entire project. I was hesitant at first because it seemed like a massive code overhaul just to fix the little problem at hand, but the reorganization wasn&#8217;t too bad and as a result the code is MUCH more organized. Thus, less problems in the future. I was basically slapped in the face with programming knowledge. Looking forward to many more of these slaps as the project progresses!</p>

        <p>With the office pretty much all set up the crew was back to working hard today. My house also has some new posters courtesy of the previous office residents. Anyway, paired a bunch with Pat again today working on refactoring some of the tax and shipping code of a recently deployed project. And in the off time from that I&#8217;ve been pressing on with the card game app. Hoping to make some real progress on Thursday (no work for July 4th tomorrow) and incorporate some of the card game logic into the rails app.</p>

        <p>Starting off week 4 in the new office. Bike ride to work is about 3 blocks shorter, severely cuts down on time though since I don&#8217;t have any real roads to ride on at all anymore. The one downside is the Mountain Sun is no longer 10 steps away from our front door but I&#8217;ll just have to learn to cope. Today I did a lot of pairing with Pat on a client project refactoring the way taxes are calculated. Red Green Refactor. Tomorrow I&#8217;m looking forward to getting the new code we wrote encorperated into the code base, and being able to say I&#8217;ve &#8216;contributed&#8217; to Viget! In other news, Hearts is pretty much coded (in Ruby), I decided to whip up Spades real quick - i.e. copy paste Hearts, tweak it a bunch, tada. Getting better at sticking to the red green refactor tactic, also getting less stuck. Started making the rails app which will host all of these games, charting into unknown territory - should be fun!</p>

        <p>Pretty cool day as usual. With all the developers in crunch mode lately I&#8217;ve had time to work on my card game project. I&#8217;ve (mostly) followed the idea of test driven development, and am definitely seeing it&#8217;s benefits. The code is getting pretty large and if there&#8217;s a small issue in one part of the code, odds are it shows up somewhere else. Without the pile of tests I&#8217;ve written along the way, I could see this project getting very frustrating and out of hand. But it&#8217;s not! I got to pair with Pat on a client project as well, some schooling in the art of TDD and code style. The learning session was cut short however once we lost internet &#8230; and the office. The rest of the day was spent disassembling desks and hefting them into and out of the moving truck. The new place is pretty sweet though. Still looking to work on my TDD approach, and some AJAX instruction would be pretty sweet too given the success of my last attempt.</p>

        <p>In Boulder news, I&#8217;m excited to report that I couldn&#8217;t really see any smoke coming off the front range today - house will not be burned down anytime soon! Stayed up pretty late redesigning the blog with the help of my up and coming designer/housemate. Started the day off continuing on with my TDD adventure of coding hearts, ran into problems when I discovered the program behaves differently whether you&#8217;re testing it or running it. Strayed from the TDD path as a result but things are looking pretty good I think. Pat took a look at my voting code for Haxxor News so I spent the rest of the day tweaking things with his suggestions, and then failing miserably at getting AJAX requests to do anything. I have discovered a pretty awesome new musician by the name of Gregory Alan Isakov, and although these cheap headphones kind of hurt my head it&#8217;s been worth it.</p>

        <p>So my usual bike ride in from South Boulder was pleasantly interrupted about 4 times with breakfast stops sponsored by whoever was involved with Boulder&#8217;s Bike To Work Day. Being that I bike to work all the time I didn&#8217;t feel too bad about stopping at multiple stops and loading another breakfast burrito into my bag. As for work, I looked back at the integration tests I wrote and cleaned them up with the knowledge I&#8217;d gained yesterday pairing with Pat. Feeling pretty good about them, I switched gears over to the card game project. Working on building code with Test Driven Development. It feels like a slower process but I feel better about my code and at any point never feel like I&#8217;m losing control diving into the rabbit hole of working on things. Excited for this project though, and for finishing up the Haxxor News app - still have a bit/lot to learn there.</p>

        <p>I pressed on with my new knowledge of tests. Spent the morning working on those, some of the afternoon getting started on some card game code, and then the last few hours pairing with Pat on the integration tests. I&#8217;m seeing the advantages of testing more with every day, realizing that with good tests your code will have a tendency to work more often. On the non-Viget side of life, Boulder&#8217;s backyard is on fire. The Flagstaff Fire kicked up around 11 am today after a lightning storm passed through. Conveniently I live about as close as you could get so I had a good view of some flames last night but the fire has stayed over the ridge so Boulder appears to be safe.</p>

        <p>Spent most of the day writing unit tests, writing integration tests, and then reading up on testing in general. I&#8217;m feeling better about the code as a result, finding a lot of hacky code that I wrote just to satisfy certain situations when I was writing it and testing it locally. Thinking about ways to refactor the code to be more stable, robust, all that jazz. Also sat down with Pat yesterday to talk about the internship so far. He gave the card playing meeting room a green light which is cool, starting to think about how I&#8217;m going to code up a bunch of card games. Looking forward to another fun and exciting week at Viget!</p>

        <p>This is really for personal record, has nothing to do with Viget, and everything to do with how great I feel about living in Boulder. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I set my alarm for 5:30, but with forecasted temperatures in the upper 90&#8217;s, I wanted to get some mountain biking in before the sun started baking this land. Packed the car, was out the door by 6, found the trail within half an hour, biked around some cows milling about then up a mountain for an hour. The trail was a little rocky but still a blast, the temperature was perfect, the pound or so of leftover steak I had waiting in the car was delicious on the drive back, and I got to hang out with some friends through the internet while watching the season finale of &#8220;The Legend of Korra&#8221;. This town is great.</p>

        <p>So with the functionality of Haxxor News pretty much done, I got to work on writing tests for it. Pat sat down with me in the afternoon for a bit to go over integration tests using RSpec and Capybara, it&#8217;s some pretty cool stuff and in another day or two once I merge together all of my progress and push forward with these tests, I think I&#8217;ll have a solid app. I think I might have thought of an idea for my next project as well - building a Tincan&#8217;d-esque site but for playing cards easily with friends. Basically, I want to play cards with my friends from back home and in the burgh. I&#8217;ll see what the crew has to say about it on Monday. In the meantime, looking forward to a scorching hot weekend in Boulder!</p>

        <p>Today was pretty solid. Was up pretty early so I could bike over to Sanitas for another morning hike with Pat &#8220;I want to set the record on this hill&#8221; Reagan, and Jason &#8220;No no, you guys just go ahead&#8221; Sperling. My todo list for Haxxor News had dwindled to password resetting, article scopes, and testing. The scopes tripped my up as I tried to work a date/range selection feature, I think the plan was to pair with Pat on it tomorrow but I got home and worked on an idea for it I had. So now I just cover the app with tests and get some of the pros to look through some of the progress.</p>

        <p>I was the only developer at the office today until lunch rolled around. And with our designing roommate Blair over at HQ I had the whole room to myself for a good while. When Pat rolled in on his newly fitted bike, we did some whiteboard work to discuss the logging of votes for the Haxxor News app. In good rails form, I ended up building another polymorphic table in the database to store them all. Not after going for the array method first though. Took care of all the little stuff I could find as well, tomorrow should just be working into the password reset, article scopes, and dreaded tests. Still trying to finish by Friday, we&#8217;ll see what gets in my way.</p>

        <p>Got another pull request out and Brian again took a look at it a few times over with suggestions and ideas for me. Today was a lot about code organization, style, and efficiency. I&#8217;m getting a grasp on what Rails is every day, a lot of the files that I&#8217;ve always just seen hanging around now have a purpose (or don&#8217;t, in which case they&#8217;re gone). Working on DRYing up code (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself), and making a habit of just writing good code first. Also got to whip out my math thinking skills to tackle the problem of counting recursive comments. It&#8217;s always fun to have to think good.</p>

        <p>Today pretty much flew by. Apart from the occasional animated gif distraction, and an Illegal Pete&#8217;s run for Buritto Monday, I was in the zone most of the day cranking out some code. I made a todo list of things to accomplish with my Haxxor News site and didn&#8217;t run into much trouble with any of the self prescribed tasks. Brian stepped aside from his work for a while to review my second pull request on the project and talk me through some of the concepts and suggestions he had brought up. The app is really coming together nicely though, I&#8217;ve discovered that Cancan is kind of a pain in the ass, I&#8217;ll probably spend some time switching authentication over to something more standard once I&#8217;m done building all the features on the list. Looking forward to another great week in Boulder though!</p>

        <p>Another great day to wrap up a pretty mind opening and interesting week! Free Lunch (Brunch in Boulder) Friday kicked off the day, it was neat to see the whole company come together, and who doesn&#8217;t like free food? Spent a good stretch of time on my Haxxor News app for the rest of the day. Brian L. took a few breaks from his work to talk thigs over and give me some hands on help. I&#8217;m trying to take in as much as I can but with all the information out there it&#8217;s a difficult and humbling task. The app is coming along though, a majority of the functionality is all in there, just have to tweak everything here and there, and then hopefully learn what testing is from the esteemed TDD-master Pat. Hoo ah.</p>

        <p>Another very educational day. Started off with a quick little hike up the Sanitas Trail with Patrick R. and Jason S. Back at the office by 9 ready to work, and with Heroku running smoothly, I could finally focus on the Haxxor News app. Made my first pull request for the project, and had it chewed apart by Patrick R. and Brian L. This was really great though, I&#8217;m learning a lot about rails, and getting some quality feedback on my code style and quality. Left the office to attend Ruby on Beer over with the guys at Foraker Labs, good food, good beer, and a bunch of good guys and gals as well. Overall another great day at Viget!</p>

        <p>Today was an educational day. Enjoyed some beer with most of the Boulder office down at West End, but not after a day of work. Got going on the Haxxor News project and then remembered around noon that the app had to be deployed on Heroku so I switched gears and spent pretty much the rest of the day on that. Once again, things I&#8217;ve learned in college are getting in the way of real progress, but with some help from sifu Brian I was on the right path eventually. It&#8217;s currently almost 10 pm but alas - the app is <a href='http://efatsi-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com/' title='Haxxor News'>up</a>!!!</p>

<p>Things I&#8217;ve learned - what Heroku is, and that I start paying more attention to instructions.<br /> Things I need to learn - how exactly Heroku works, as well as Rails.</p>

        <p>Well the blog is up and running. Compliments on the looks have come in but credit really goes to my friend - Mr. Bootstrap. Today was much more productive than day 1 - my new machine isn&#8217;t offering up any problems now that Brian took a look at it, AND there were free/delicious burritos to be had from Illegal Pete&#8217;s thanks to the monthly dev meeting where I got to meet the developers from the other offices. Bike ride home isn&#8217;t looking too fun as the smoke from the High Park Wildfire starts to roll in, but I&#8217;ve got some ruby/rails notes at home that I&#8217;m looking forward to whipping out for the newly assigned &#8220;Haxxor News&#8221; project. The learning continues!!!</p>

        <p>This is the first post of my blog detailing my days and adventures at Viget Labs, in Boulder, Colorado. Today was pretty exciting as I got to meet all of the employees at the Boulder office and get my machine set up with the tools I&#8217;ll be needing for the start of the summer. I learned today that my high school tricks will not apply, and that I have a LOT to learn this summer. I&#8217;m ready to work hard and make the most of this however. As for things I don&#8217;t understand and things I want to learn &#8211; the broad category of everything should just about cover it.</p>
