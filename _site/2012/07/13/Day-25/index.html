	<p>Great day. I have return with full momentum to the card game application. I dug into that weird bug that popped up yesterday, and determined that the computer was just possessed, and afraid of the number 7. It&#8217;s pretty weird, if one of my tests has been run more than 7 times, then one of the functions, which changes an attribute of four &#8220;cards&#8221;, just decides to not alter one of the cards. In the past when I assume the computer has gone crazy it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;ve missed something and am being dumb, but this time &#8230; my computer is definitely just messing with me. Anyway, today I made some progress in the &#8220;make it work&#8221; field. I&#8217;ve written some (bad) code that lets me interact with a lot of my card game functions I wrote. But basically, I can step through parts of a theoretical game and see what exactly is going on in the background. Discovered a good amount of things that don&#8217;t work as they should - a testament to how much I have to learn about testing. All my tests passing should mean that the app works, but, nope. I&#8217;ve learned that I can&#8217;t rely on rails to list owned resources in the order they were assigned, and that I should be keeping track of things in a more direct way (i.e. confidently point to exactly what I want instead of pointing to the third thing in a list I didn&#8217;t create and hoping what I want is actually third in the list). I opened up a Dale&#8217;s Pale Ale and got to a pretty decent stopping point by the end of the day, realized that this internship is awesome, and am looking forward to a great weekend!</p>
