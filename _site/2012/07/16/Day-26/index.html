	<p>Came into the office after a truly fantastic Boulder weekend, excited to push the card game app to some new limits this week. I spent the day debugging a bit and refactoring the way the leader and dealer were kept track of (with seats!). Didn&#8217;t take too long at all, biggest obstacle was the fact that I&#8217;d forgotten to update the test database so it was just failing all over the place. Realized it pretty quickly though and was feeling pretty good about things. Until my meeting with Pat and Brian about my progress so far. There were some pretty major suggestions involving changing a lot of the way the system is currently organized. I was stubborn at first since I feel the way it is now is very representative of how a card game plays in real life, and then particularly not feeling so hot about it when I realized it would be easier to practically start over than simply change what I have now. I&#8217;m pretty sure I can knock it out in a good 2 days work though and get back to where I was with a more organized project. There are some cool things to dive into at that point given the way the site will have to update continuously - still pretty pumped on this project. Ahh, and <a href='/vigeclones.html'>this</a> is what happens when the intern is the last one in the office.</p>
