	<p>So I was a little bummed that I would have to back track a bit on the project. I felt like I had developed some solid code and the meeting went differently than I had hoped. But once again, believe it or not, Pat and Brian were right! I was hoping that once I got into the redoing of everything I would see the light and I definitely did. I flew threw everything. What took me about a week was almost all knocked out in one day. I owe this to the new organization of the code for sure, but also to the fact that I think I&#8217;m getting a hang of this test driven development stuff. Red Green Refactor. I&#8217;m much better at navigating and tracking down bugs, either with my code, or with the way tests interact with the code (reload and (true) fix most of my problems)(or I forgot to save a resource when I &#8216;changed&#8217; it so changes don&#8217;t stick). A little database-landy and a little less representative of what actually happens, but then again I&#8217;m not playing cards in real life, this all will happen in database land. So ya, desk is cluttered with a bunch of checked off to-do lists and little drawings to help me through this all, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty pumped again for this project.</p>
